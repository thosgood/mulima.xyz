# About

## Planned content

- xx4yy articles, where xx and yy are [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (à la [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/))
  + Just the things you need to get started reading (and possibly writing) maths, e.g. overview of grammar, and then straight into sentences like "Let A be an abelian group, and ..."
  + Aimed specifically for speakers of yy, noting any similarities and differences between xx and yy
- Improved version of [maths-dictionary](https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary/)
  + Ability to log in (via Google, GitHub, or whatever) and then suggest translations, review existing suggestions, etc. (à la Weblate)
  + An actual database backend (instead of some unstructured mess of .json files...)
  + Static version downloads (e.g. PDF)
- Community-written blog
  + Expository mathematical articles written (mostly) in languages other than English
