# About

## Planned content
- Improved version of [maths-dictionary](https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary/)
  + Ability to log in (via Google, GitHub, or whatever) and then suggest translations, review existing suggestions, etc. (similar to how Weblate functions)
  + An actual database backend (instead of some unstructured mess of .json files...)
  + Static version downloads (e.g. PDF)
- Community-written blog
  + Expository mathematical articles written (mostly) in languages other than English
- Parallel texts
  + Expository articles with synchronised translations
- `xx4yy` articles, where `xx` and `yy` are [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (e.g. `FR4EN` would be French for English speakers)
  + Just the things you need to get started reading (and possibly writing) maths, e.g. overview of grammar, and then straight into sentences like "Let A be an abelian group, and ..."
  + Aimed specifically for speakers of yy, noting any similarities and differences between xx and yy
  + Whirlwind tour, a bit like [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) (and maybe even taking a similar point of view, in that e.g. `FR4EN` should be written more in French than in English)
  + Gould's [*Russian for the Mathematician*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-65384-1) is probably a very good resource to mimic (and, less related, but at least mildly similar in aim, is Martin and Ng's [*A Foundation Course in Reading German*](https://wisc.pb.unizin.org/readinggerman/))
